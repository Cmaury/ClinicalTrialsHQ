Intro:
ClinicalTrialsHQ.com allows patients to search open clinical trials 
and receive notifications as new trials open for their condition.
This is a Django project, and follows the basic structure outlined here:
http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/

Starter data:
Clinicaltrials.gov publishes all trial data in xml format.
This data can be downloaded here:
http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recr=Open&no_unk=Y&show_down=Y#down

Project contents:
The project includes the following:
crawl.py - hits clinicaltrials.gov and retrieve updated trials data.
import.py - parses the xml data, create a django fixture, and import into DB.
notifier.py - checks new trials for matching alert notifications and sends emails.
trials/models.py - Database model

Reasoning:
I built clinicaltrialsHQ for two reasons: 
1. It's a fun project to practice coding.
2. I had a need.

I was diagnosed with Stargardt's disease (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargardt_disease), 
and since there is no cure, I started looking for open clinical trials. clinicaltrials.gov
is a great resource for practitioners, but is a little overwhelming for patients. Additionally, 
you have to keep visisint the site, to check for new trials. This project is meant to be a more
patient friendly site, that allows patients to be notified when there are new trials.

This is the first website that I have built from scratch. It's not complete. I still need to do all the CSS,
and improve the search results and data integrity, but it's a start. One that I am proud of, and one that I'm
going to keep working on.
